## How to Use

### 📝 Markdown Editor
*   **Write Content**: Use standard Markdown syntax (headings, lists, bold, italics, links) in the "Markdown" tab to structure your resume.
*   **Tips**:
    *   Use `#` for your name (H1).
    *   `##` for sections like "Experience" or "Education" (H2).
    *   `*` or `-` for bulleted lists.
    *   `**text**` for bold, `*text*` for italics.
    *   `[Link Text](URL)` for links.

### 🎨 CSS Editor
*   **Style Your Resume**: Switch to the "CSS" tab to write custom CSS rules. These styles apply *only* to your resume preview, ensuring no interference with the app's interface.
*   **Elements**: Target standard HTML elements (`body`, `h1`, `p`, `ul`, `li`, `a`) or specific IDs/classes you add in your Markdown.
*   **Example**: Change font, colors, margins, or add borders.

### 👁️ Live Preview
*   As you type in either editor, the "Resume Preview" panel updates in real-time, showing you exactly how your resume will look.
