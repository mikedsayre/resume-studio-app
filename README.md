# Resume Studio

Resume Studio is a modern web application designed to help users create and style their professional resumes with ease. Utilizing Markdown for content and custom CSS for styling, it offers a live preview experience, ensuring your resume looks exactly as you intend before exporting. Built with a mobile-first approach, Resume Studio is responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Features

*   **Markdown Editor**: Write your resume content using a simple yet powerful Markdown editor.
*   **Custom CSS Editor**: Tailor the visual appearance of your resume with a dedicated CSS editor.
*   **Live Preview**: See your resume update in real-time as you type, reflecting both content and style changes.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Isolated Styling**: Ensures your custom CSS only affects the resume preview, preventing conflicts with the application's UI.
*   **File Import/Export**: Easily import existing Markdown (`.md`) or CSS (`.css`) files, and export your current content for backup or sharing.
